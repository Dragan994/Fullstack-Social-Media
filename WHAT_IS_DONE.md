# Login and Register system
# JWT auth that sings client after login and veryfies it at every '/user' request for now, as long token is saved in localStorage.
# Language translation similar to 'i18', in html it is written the same way, and works as a pipe.
# Socket.io for chat service and later maybe for gaming communication
#   
#   This was all just making of a base for project sort of a backbone...
